# Open Graph Image Guide

## What is it?
An Open Graph (OG) image is the preview image that appears when you share your website link on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.).

## Current Setup
Your site is configured to use `/og-image.jpg` (1200x630px)

## How to Create One

### Option 1: Use an existing photo
- Take your best profile photo or a screenshot of your site
- Resize to **1200px x 630px**
- Save as `og-image.jpg` in `/public/`

### Option 2: Design a custom one
Use tools like:
- **Canva** (free): https://canva.com
  - Search for "Open Graph" template
  - Customize with your name, title, colors
  
- **Figma** (free): Create 1200x630 artboard
  
- **Photoshop/GIMP**: Design at 1200x630px

## Temporary Solution
Until you create a custom OG image, you can:
1. Use your profile photo (`/me-square.jpg`) - already in your public folder
2. Create a simple one at https://ogimage.gallery/
